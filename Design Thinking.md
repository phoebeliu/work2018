User ----empathy map

Says      think

Does     Feel

- **Journey Map** – a means of documenting a user’s experience from start-to-finish. Journey maps vary from practitioner to practitioner. All journey maps seek to find a user’s pain, their motivations, or design opportunities for a user. This may be likened to an empathy map but viewed over the course of an experience rather than a general view of a user during a single point in time.
- **Pain Points** – blockers in a user’s experience. These may be emotional, technological, process-based, or physical. Severity of pain will vary with each example.
- **Big Idea** – a holistic and open-ended solution to a user’s pain based in a user’s motivation or needs.
- **Feature** – a prescriptive non-holistic response to a user’s pain based in technology.
- **Vignette** – a brief but descriptive depiction of events.
- **“Getting Caught in the Weeds”** – an idiom that refers to being distracted by details and losing sight of the intended purpose.
- **Self-compassion** – allowing for kindness and mindful forgiveness of oneself during times of failure
- **Storyboard** – a visual form of storytelling used to show a user’s journey. Comprised of panels filled with art (high or low fidelity) and accompanying text.

- **Roadmap** – a time-based mapping of design decisions and the user impact of those decisions
