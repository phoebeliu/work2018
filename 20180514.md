1.xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun.

Open Terminal, and run the following:

```
xcode-select --install
```

This will download and install xcode developer tools and fix the problem. The problem is that one needs to explicitly agree to the license agreement.

I found the solution in this question, Command Line Tools not working.

```
helped me after upgrading to macOS High Sierra and tried to run git status
```

2.update git password

To fix this, you can use

```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

You'll then be prompted for your password again.

For Windows, it's the same command with a different argument:

```
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

None of the other answers worked for me on MacOS Sierra 10.12.4

Here is what I had to do:

```
git config --global --unset user.password
```

Then run your git command (ex. git push) and reenter your username and password.
