1.xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun.

Open Terminal, and run the following:

    xcode-select --install

This will download and install xcode developer tools and fix the problem. The problem is that one needs to explicitly agree to the license agreement.

I found the solution in this question, Command Line Tools not working.

    helped me after upgrading to macOS High Sierra and tried to run git status
