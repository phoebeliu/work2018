**Short answer**: do you really need such function or you can use property? <http://jsfiddle.net/awnqm/1/>

**Long answer**

For simplicity I will describe only your case - ngRepet for array of objects. Also, I'll omit some details.

AngularJS uses [dirty checking](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682092/databinding-in-angularjs/9693933#9693933) for detecting changes. When application is started it runs [`$digest`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest)for [`$rootScope`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope). `$digest` will do depth-first traversal for [scope's hierarchy](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope). All scopes have list of watches. Each watch has last value (initially `initWatchVal`). For each scope for all watches `$digest` runs it, gets current value (`watch.get(scope)`) and compares it to `watch.last`. If current value not equal to `watch.last` (always for first compare) `$digest` set `dirty` to `true`. When all scopes are processed if `dirty == true` `$digest` starts another depth-first traversal from `$rootScope`. `$digest` ends when dirty == false or number of traversals == 10. In the latter case, the error "10 $digest() iterations reached." will be logged.

Now about `ngRepeat`. For each `watch.get` call it stores objects from collection (returning value of `getEntities`) with aditional information in cache ([`HashQueueMap`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/f2b7fffdc0b0ad80cebb24f5fea743e9e4a439d5/src/apis.js#L73) by `hashKey`). For every `watch.get` call `ngRepeat` try to get object by its `hashKey` from cache. If it does not exist in cache, `ngRepeat` stores it in cache, creates new scope, puts object on it, creates DOM element, [etc](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/1d388676e3b97b6171fc498e82545bd437ee6fd1/src/ng/directive/ngRepeat.js#L148).

Now about [`hashKey`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/f2b7fffdc0b0ad80cebb24f5fea743e9e4a439d5/src/apis.js#L16). Usually `hashKey` is unique number generated by [`nextUid()`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/5c95b8cccc0d72f7ca3afb1162b9528c1222eb3c/src/Angular.js#L156). But it can be [function](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/f2b7fffdc0b0ad80cebb24f5fea743e9e4a439d5/src/apis.js#L21). `hashKey` is stored in object after generating for future use.

**Why your example generates error**: function `getEntities()` always returns array with new object. This object doesn't have `hashKey` and doesn't exist in `ngRepeat` cache. So `ngRepeat` on each `watch.get` generates new scope for it with new watch for `{{entity.id}}`. This watch on first `watch.get` has `watch.last == initWatchVal`. So `watch.get() != watch.last`. So `$digest` starts new traverse. So `ngRepeat` creates new scope with new watch. So ... after 10 traverses you get error.

**How you can fix it**

1. Do not create new objects on every `getEntities()` call.
2. If you need create new objects you can add `hashKey` method for them. See [this topic](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/angular/IEIQok-YkpU) for examples.

Hope people who know AngularJS internals correct me if I'm wrong in something.
