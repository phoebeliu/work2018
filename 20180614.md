1. git access denied

   run as administer

   > git config --system --unset credential.helper

   unable to access 'https://git.mmi.mig.corp/portal/agentportal.git/': SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

   > git config --global http.sslVerify false

   C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Atlassian\SourceTree

   C:\Users\t967346\AppData\Local\Atlassian\SourceTree

   The only thing that worked for me was navigating to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Atlassian\SourceTree and removing the passwd file.

   Once this file is removed, restart SourceTree and execute a fetch or something else that requires access to the repo in question. SourceTree will then prompt you for your password, rewriting the cached credentials.

   I hope this helps. Shoutout to my buddy Nick for the assist.

   If you're a macOS user, Auke states below that "you can find the password files per repo it in ~/Library/Application Support/SourceTree"
