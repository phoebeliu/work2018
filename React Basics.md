## Running a simple local HTTP server

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#Running_a_simple_local_HTTP_server

1.Install Python

2.Open your command prompt (Windows)/ terminal (macOS/ Linux). To check Python is installed, enter the following command:

```bash
python -V
```

3.This should return a version number. If this is OK, navigate to the directory that your example is inside, using the `cd` command.

4.Enter the command to start up the server in that directory:

```
# If Python version returned above is 3.X
python3 -m http.server
# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed â€” click the HTML file you want to run.

**Note**: If you already have something running on port 8000, you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 7800` (Python 3.x) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800` (Python 2.x). You can then access your content at `localhost:7800`.
