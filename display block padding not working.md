# display block padding not working

Label i have too long content in it. i want them be break into two lines.

but even i wrote `display:block`i still have no padding or margin work.

So i am lost......

finally, i see this `white-space: nowrap`

Collapses white space as for `normal`, but suppresses line breaks (text wrapping) within the source.

this is why padding margin don't work...`white-space:nowrap`
