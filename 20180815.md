[JavaScript Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752), by Stoyan Stefanov, is a great book on writing solid JavaScript code. On page 134, Stoyan Stafanov shows how to write a recursive deep-extend function.

Also, studying source code is a great way to learn! [Here's jQuery's implementation of $.extend](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js).

Skip down to line 124 (the line may move, so you can also use the browser's find in page and type in 'extend' to see where it is defined `(jQuery.extend = â€¦)`.

#### Build Your Own Frond-End Application

[Here are some HTML and CSS files](https://treehouse-code-samples.s3.amazonaws.com/Expressjs_REST_API_course_client_files.zip) you can use to build a front-end web application that consumes the API we built in this course. Feel free to use any framework, such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), or [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), or just build it with vanilla JavaScript for an extra challenge.

#### Example Front-End Application

[Here is an example application](https://treehouse-code-samples.s3.amazonaws.com/Expressjs_REST_API_course_client_app.zip) to explore if you wish. Keep in mind this is just one of many ways to consume the API. To run the front-end app, unzip the attached archive, and inside the directory run

```
$ npm install && nodemon
```

This will create a small server that will serve the app on port 3001. Be sure you have the API running on its own port (3000 should be the default) in a separate terminal window. Once both servers are running, you can view the front-end app by going to

```
localhost:3001
```

in Chrome or Firefox.
