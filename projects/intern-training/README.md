# Front end basic

Every command in this documentation is to be executed on the command line in the root folder of this project!

## Setup

1. Install NPM dependencies ```npm install```
2. (if not done before) Install Gulp in global scope ```npm install gulp -g```

## Development Instruction
Run ```gulp```

This will start a local development server on ```http://localhost:3434``` and will automatically build and deploy changes, whenever the code is changing.
