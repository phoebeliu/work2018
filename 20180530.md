Jen Simmons has a great video that talks about[desgining for the fourth edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQHtT47eH0M&feature=youtu.be)— with CSS Grid. I highly recommend you watch it.

If you’d like to find out more about what CSS Grid can do, check out[Jen Simmon’s lab](http://labs.jensimmons.com/), where she explores how to create different kinds of layouts with CSS Grid and other tools.

If you’d like to dig deeper,[Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan)has an article to help you[create non-rectangular layouts](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-shapes/).

CSS shapes and`clip-path`give you infinite possibilities to create custom shapes unique to your designs. Unfortunately, syntax-wise, CSS shapes and`clip-path`aren’t as intuitive as CSS Grid. Luckily, we have tools such as[Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/)and[Firefox’s Shape Path Editor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Edit_CSS_shapes)to help us create the shapes we want.

CSS’`writing-mode`makes text flow in the direction native to each language. Hui Jing experimented with a Chinese-based layout that flows top down and right to left on a website called[Penang Hokkien](http://penang-hokkien.gitlab.io/). You can read more about her experiment in her article, “[The One About Home](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/the-one-about-home/#%F0%9F%8F%80)”.

Besides articles, Hui Jing has a great talk on typography and`writing-mode`, “[When East Meets West: Web Typography and How It Can Inspire Modern Layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqxo269aORM)”. I highly encourage you to watch it.

[Jen Simmons’s lab](http://labs.jensimmons.com/)contains many experiments with`writing-mode`, too. I highly recommend checking it out, too.



For example, in[Super Silly Hackathon](https://supersillyhackathon.sg/),[Cheeaun](https://twitter.com/cheeaun)rotates the entire website by -15 degrees and makes you look silly when reading the website.

[Darin Senneff](https://twitter.com/dsenneff)made an[animated login avatar](https://codepen.io/dsenneff/pen/QajVxO)with some trigonometry and GSAP. Look at how cute the ape is and how it covers its eyes when you focus on the password field. Lovely!
