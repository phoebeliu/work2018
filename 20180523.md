### [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-2)

Class--{property,methods}--object

ES2015

> syntactic sugar

JavaScript uses something called prototypes and the syntax for creating prototypes before ES2015 was complicated and confusing for many developers.

To make object oriented JavaScript easier to understand,the class syntax was developed.has the same functionality as the prototype syntax.

Even though the syntax resembles class based programming,we're still using prototypes under the hood.

[Documentation for Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

[Documentation for Constructor Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Class_body_and_method_definitions)

```javascript
class Pet{
  constructor(a,b,c){
    this.a=a;
    this.b=b;
    this.c=c;
  }
  speak(){
    return this.c;
  }
}
const adog = new Pet('s',2,'dd');
```

> constructor method

> 

A constructor method goes at the top, inside a class.This is a special method and it's where you outline the properties that your class will have.When you create an object from this class later on,what you're really doing is invoking this constructor method, and like regular methods, you can pass in parameters.

### Understanding "this"

Understanding how to use the`this`keyword can seem confusing at first. For more information, check out this[Treehouse workshop](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/understanding-this-in-javascript).

You can also read the documentation on[MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), which has some other examples.

### JavaScript Date Object

If you enjoyed playing around the with JavaScript Date Object, check out the following documentation to learn more about it.

[JavaScript Date Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

Universal Time is not your current, local time. It's a global time standard based on the earth's rotation. The local time where you live is converted from Universal Time. In JavaScript, you may have to make conversions from UTC to local time.

```javascript
class Pet{
  constructor(a,b,c){
    this.a=a;
    this.b=b;
    this.c=c;
  }
  get activity(){
    const today = new Date();
    const hour = today.getHours();
    if(hour >20){
      return 'sleep';
    }else{
      return 'play';
    }
  }
}
```

> So what is a getter method?

In JavaScript it's a special method used when you want to have a property that has a dynamic or computed value.The value of the property is computed in the getter method.This special method allowed you to create and dynamically retrieve the value of a property called activity.Even though this property wasn't declared and set in a constructor method like the other properties were,you can access it's value the same way, using dot or bracket notation.But remember if you were to output the earning object to the console you would not see the new activity property.

```javascript
class Student {
    constructor(gpa, credits){
        this.gpa = gpa;
        this.credits = credits;
    }

    stringGPA() {
        return this.gpa.toString();
    }
  get level(){
    if(this.credits <= 30){
      return 'Freshman';
    }else if(this.credits >= 31 && this.credits <= 60){
      return 'Sophomore';
    }else if(this.credits >= 61 && this.credits <= 90){
      return 'Junior'; 
    }else if(this.credits > 90){
      return 'Senior'; 
    }
  }
}

const student = new Student(3.9);
```

### Getters and Setters

Here's some relevant documentation on getters and setters.

[Defining Getters and Setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Defining_getters_and_setters)

```javascript
get owner(){
  return this._owner;
}
set owner(owner){
  this._owner = owner;
  console.log(`setter called : ${owner}`);
}

XX.owner = 'www';
console.log(XX.owner);
```

### Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions, or Regex, are a powerful way to search and match string combinations. The format can be a little complicated, so save this documentation for reference.

[Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

```javascript
class Owner{
  constructor(name,addr){
    this.name = name;
    this.addr = addr;
  }
  set phone(phone){
    const phoneNormalized = phone.replace(/[^0-9]/g,'');
    this._phone = phoneNormalized;
  }
  get phone(){
    renturn this._phone;
  }
}
XX.owner = new Owner('www','1882');
XX.owner.phone = '10292878988';
```

> 2.  _.sortBy underscore.js 使用js等于会出现脱绑，因为sortby方法在于重建一个中间值。

```javascript
// Sort the object's values by a criterion produced by an iteratee.
  _.sortBy = function(obj, iteratee, context) {
    iteratee = cb(iteratee, context);
    return _.pluck(_.map(obj, function(value, index, list) {
      return {
        value: value,
        index: index,
        criteria: iteratee(value, index, list)
      };
    }).sort(function(left, right) {
      var a = left.criteria;
      var b = right.criteria;
      if (a !== b) {
        if (a > b || a === void 0) return 1;
        if (a < b || b === void 0) return -1;
      }
      return left.index - right.index;
    }), 'value');
  };
```
