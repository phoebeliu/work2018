### [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/objectoriented-javascript-2)

Class--{property,methods}--object

ES2015

> syntactic sugar

JavaScript uses something called prototypes and the syntax for creating prototypes before ES2015 was complicated and confusing for many developers.

To make object oriented JavaScript easier to understand,the class syntax was developed.has the same functionality as the prototype syntax.

Even though the syntax resembles class based programming,we're still using prototypes under the hood.

```javascript
class Pet{
  constructor(a,b,c){
    this.a=a;
    this.b=b;
    this.c=c;
  }
  speak(){
    return this.c;
  }
}
const adog = new Pet('s',2,'dd');
```

> constructor method
> 
> 

A constructor method goes at the top, inside a class.This is a special method and it's where you outline the properties that your class will have.When you create an object from this class later on,what you're really doing is invoking this constructor method, and like regular methods, you can pass in parameters.

### Understanding "this"

Understanding how to use the`this`keyword can seem confusing at first. For more information, check out this[Treehouse workshop](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/understanding-this-in-javascript).

You can also read the documentation on[MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), which has some other examples.

> 2.  _.sortBy underscore.js 使用js等于会出现脱绑，因为sortby方法在于重建一个中间值。

```javascript
// Sort the object's values by a criterion produced by an iteratee.
  _.sortBy = function(obj, iteratee, context) {
    iteratee = cb(iteratee, context);
    return _.pluck(_.map(obj, function(value, index, list) {
      return {
        value: value,
        index: index,
        criteria: iteratee(value, index, list)
      };
    }).sort(function(left, right) {
      var a = left.criteria;
      var b = right.criteria;
      if (a !== b) {
        if (a > b || a === void 0) return 1;
        if (a < b || b === void 0) return -1;
      }
      return left.index - right.index;
    }), 'value');
  };
```
