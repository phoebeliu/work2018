# [Should I be using both AngularJS and ASP.NET MVC?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/305838/should-i-be-using-both-angularjs-and-asp-net-mvc)

If you're building a[single page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), then you probably don't need the "MVC" in[ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc). Views, especially dynamic views, are likely delivered/manipulated client-side. Angular handles that just fine.

But maybe you don't want a 100% SPA. Then what? Imagine instead 10 pages, but 10 pages that are_very_dynamic. After a user logs on, there's a little user badge up in the right-hand corner. That's not dynamic. It just shows a few nifty things like the user's "score" and their latest selfie. You cache the nifty things so they can be easily retrieved. Now, you can go two ways with this. If you're a client-side MVC purist, you just fetch the badge data after the initial HTML payload is delivered, just like all the other data. But maybe you're not a purist. Maybe you're the opposite of a purist. Maybe you're an impurist. So, instead of delivering the initial HTML, delivering some JavaScript that will post back to your server, post via JavaScript to grab badge data, and then ultimately merge that data into a view via client-side MVC, you simply decide to merge the data already in your cache into a view on the server and then deliver_that_as your initial HTML. After your initial HTML is delivered, you proceed with your typical client-side MVC antics.

So... MVC on the server and on the client is just a convenient way to organize code that used to be a mess in 2001. You don't have to choose one or the other. You can choose both. Granted, the more you do after that initial HTML is delivered, the less you need server-side MVC. Still, it's there for you if you need it. For example, I worked on a ASP.NET MVC/Angular application where external Angular templates might actually be .NET MVC ActionResult. That means your server controller could merge data into its view, deliver it to Angular as a template, and Angular's controller could then merge its data into the view. I'm not saying this is a good idea, but it just shows that one form of MVC doesn't make the other obsolete.

Besides, no matter how you deploy Angular, you're going to need a way to deliver that initial HTML, the templates, and most importantly the data. Why not use a platform that makes it easy? There are many, but .NET MVC is no slouch. Like I said, you can make the initial HTML and external Angular templates the result of an MVC action, but better yet, you can use .NET'S[Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api)to deliver the data. Web API is as delicious as apricot compote.

Summarized: MVC is just a pattern. You may want to use that pattern on any number of physical layers. It can't be used up. Use it freely if it makes sense. Besides,[Angular may not be MVC anyway](https://plus.google.com/+AngularJS/posts/aZNVhj355G2)(so says people who care about these things), so feel free to use it with a tool that has "MVC" in the name. Hell, even if it is MVC, mix and match as desired.



- Can you tell me, for example if there's a web api that's providing me with data, and I want to show this data in grid, do I do the looping and templating using Angular or MVC? Do I call the web api service using which how? How do you decide from the beginning of the project which way you're going to go?– [Natalie](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/208578/natalie "355 reputation")[Dec 25 '15 at 13:01](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/305838/should-i-be-using-both-angularjs-and-asp-net-mvc#comment640888_305846)
- @Natalie If the data is from Web API, you're likely fetching it client-side. This means you're binding in Angular, not .NET MVC. You don't explicitly loop. You bind the data to your grid/table using[ngRepeat](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat). To fetch the data, you'd likely use the[$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/%24http)module and call your Web API endpoint. As for deciding which approach to use, that's quirky. There's no black and white answer. You have to experiment, evaluate, and follow your instincts.– [Scant Roger](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/17429/scant-roger "8,418 reputation")[Dec 25 '15 at 22:47](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/305838/should-i-be-using-both-angularjs-and-asp-net-mvc#comment640927_305846)

  3 years later, use ASP.NET Web API to serve up your data and Angular (js or newer) to structure your app on the client side. If you're making a static site then just use ASP.NET MVC.

map

# Array.prototype.map()

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map

```javascript
var array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]

```

# EventTarget.addEventListener()

_target_.addEventListener(_type_, _listener\[_, _options_\]);
_

target_.addEventListener(_type_, _listener\[_, _useCapture_\]);
_

target_.addEventListener(_type_, _listener\[_, _useCapture_, _wantsUntrusted _ \]); // Gecko/Mozilla only



`useCapture`Optional

A[`Boolean`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean "The Boolean object is an object wrapper for a boolean value.")indicating whether events of this type will be dispatched to the registered`listener`_before_being dispatched to any`EventTarget`beneath it in the DOM tree. Events that are bubbling upward through the tree will not trigger a listener designated to use capture. Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of propagating events which occur in an element that is nested within another element, when both elements have registered a handle for that event. The event propagation mode determines the order in which elements receive the event. See[DOM Level 3 Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow)and[JavaScript Event order](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html#link4)for a detailed explanation. If not specified,`useCapture`defaults to`false`.

**Note:**For event listeners attached to the event target, the event is in the target phase, rather than the capturing and bubbling phases. Events in the target phase will trigger all listeners on an element in the order they were registered, regardless of the`useCapture`parameter.

**Note:**`useCapture`has not always been optional. Ideally, you should include it for the widest possible browser compatibility.
